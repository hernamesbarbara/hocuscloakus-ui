I created a UI frontend prototype using Create.xyz. I downloaded the entire project to my local machine. 

The entire Create project is here: side-by-side-viewer/apps/web/

The project is this vite.js app. I want to create a brand new Vite.js app and incorporate just the files that are absolutely necessary from the create.xyz project bundle while ignoring lots of superfluous files that come with the create.xyz project bundle download. 

for example, the server entrypoint on the backend is in ./__create/index.ts. that is a file that is specifically related to create.xyz and that i do not want to keep in my new vite app's source code. 

how should i go about creating my new vite app with just the UI elements needed for the UI and ignoring all the other junk related to create.xyz but not directly necessary for the UI?

Run the app like this: 

```bash
npm --prefix side-by-side-viewer/apps/web/ run dev

> dev
> react-router dev

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:4000/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.0.64:4000/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```

When the server is running you can view the UI by visiting http://localhost:4000/.

You are a highly skilled frontend engineer. Think hard: your goal is to review the prototype generated by Create.xyz, understand all the React Components and how they work. 

Then, using your research into the prototype, create a plan to build a brand new vite.js app here in the project root. Your plan should include all steps necessary to create a new Vite app using the UI components from the Create.xyz prototype. Save your technical memo to a new file: FEAT_PORT_CREATE_TO_VITE.md. 

You do not need to implement anything yet. You just need to research, plan, and document. 

Good starting points include:
- read side-by-side-viewer/apps/web/package.json
- Quick audit: what do you actually need for the UI? Find Create.xyz-specific server/runtime glue we will NOT keep
- Find UI libraries we WILL likely keep (adjust list if you know others)
- Find CSS frameworks / styles in use. 
- Find absolute imports that rely on path aliases (we'll recreate ‘@’ ⇒ src)
- List top-level UI component folders (so we copy the right ones)
- Scaffold a brand-new minimal Vite React app
- Routing: use react-router-dom (client) for in-app navigation
- UI: bring only what your components actually use (e.g., Chakra or Tailwind or both if truly needed).
- Install only what’s necessary (adjust after Step 1 audit)
- If Tailwind is used, configure it properly
- Minimal vite.config.ts (no Create.xyz plugins)
- Create vite.config.ts like this (note: no reactRouterHonoServer, no custom ./plugins/..., no __create)
- Minimal React entry (client-only)
- Copy only the UI files you actually use (From the Create.xyz project, copy just these kinds of files into our new vite `app: src/components/**` etc. Do NOT copy files like these: `__create/**` or `src/__create/**` etc.)
- Fix imports & aliases (Replace any imports like @/something with relative paths or enable the @ alias)
- Remove/replace any imports that reference
- Install only the UI deps your components actually use
- Verify and run
- Optional cleanup / Remove unused deps


Your target audience for your FEAT_PORT_CREATE_TO_VITE.md memo is you. We will work together in a future coding session to implement your plan. Make sure you write the memo to be maximally useful to you in the future.
